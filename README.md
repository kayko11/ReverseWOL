# ReverseWOL
Lets you turn off your PC with a WOL packet

Replaced the .PS1 script by itself with a batch file to help with installing ReverseWOL as a windows service allowing it to run on startup.
 
 1. Extract the zip, Edit the .bat file first with notepad. 
 
 2. Change the file path of the script ("C:\\<Users>\\<file_path>\reversewol.ps1") and replace it with the location of the reversewol.ps1 script in your system

 3. Close the batch file and run it as admin
 
 4. You now have Reverse Wake On Lan Abilities, using the same app for WOL you can shut off your PC
